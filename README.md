# BudgetApp

## Why?

BudgetApp is designed to simplify personal finance management for users who seek an easy-to-use solution for tracking their income and expenses.

## What?

BudgetApp is a straightforward web application that helps users keep track of their finances. It allows users to record their transactions, monitor their income, and manage their expenses conveniently in one place.

## How?

BudgetApp utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to provide a user-friendly experience:

1. **Transactions Overview**: Users can quickly see their account balance, income, and expenses at a glance. A simple chart illustrates spending habits, and recent transactions are listed for easy reference.

2. **Income Tracking**: Users can add their income using a basic form and view all recorded incomes. Removing any income entry is straightforward.

3. **Expense Management**: Adding expenses is effortless with BudgetApp. Users can input their expenses, review them in a list, and delete entries as needed.


## Running BudgetApp

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/WSB-projekt-zespolowy/BudgetApp.git

   ```

5. **Install dependencies and start the backend:**
